I created a Morse code encoder-decoder for encoding and decoding using the ASCII values of alphabets and numbers. You can also write a letter in this that can be easily converted into Morse code and then easily converted back to text.

Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
